# Unit_1_Project 

Jeremy Kolker's Portfolio Website
A place to learn information about me, Jeremy Kolker, a newly burgeoning software developer.

-- HTML explanation: --

-An "accordian" style layout, without multiple sections compartmentalized into DIV elements and DIV elements within containers.
-The sections hide and expand it's contents upon selection.
-The header elements contain display titles that explain the theme of each section: "about me", "resume", etc.
-I attempted to adaptand reintergrate the functionality of my original approach of hiding/displaying my div contents, by containing the webpages' div sections within a more modern looking navigation bar. If I had more time, I'd continue working down that path. Needless to say, the navbar contents displayed on my project are non-functional. 
-Inside the 'About Me' section is a slideshow that represents experiences from my previous professions and a soft elevator pitch.
-Inside the 'Resume' section is a downloadable, clickable link to my resume.
-Inside the projects section is placeholder text that will eventually hold my GA and personal software engineering projects.
-Finally, symbol/iconographic hyperlinks to my social media and other relevant sources.


-- CSS explanation: --
-A lot of styling went into my seemingly simple visual layout. 
-I worked especially hard on responsive design capabilities and the general tone of the web space. 
-I sought to remove them, but it's possible there is some redundant CSS styling, especially when I compartmentalized divs inside divs inside containers. If I had more time I'd experiment more and streamline any existing redundancies.


-- jQuery/Javascript explanation: --
-Within my window onload function are several variables: 
    * numOfImages represents an ordered index of the slideshow photographs
    * currentImgIndex tracks the index value of the selected image
-There's also several functions used with multiple jQuery methods:
    * Next/previous functions that increments or decrements through our slideshow by accessing the child elements of the slideshow/image container and adjusting the correlating css styling to display the img tied to the current index position (and hide all else).
    * The other function is a click event function that finds/displays the selected sections and hide all else.
     -I accomplished this function with quite a few methods: a combination of the .parent .not & .find methods (to access the correct comparmentalized elements). Finally, the fadeToggle and fadOut methods are used to display or hide the section accessed elements.
